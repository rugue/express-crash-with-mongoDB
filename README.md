# Express and MongoDB CRUD API

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows you to manage posts with basic operations like creating a new post, retrieving all posts, retrieving a single post by ID, updating a post, and deleting a post.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a cloud-based solution)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (for testing the API)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-mongodb-crud-api.git
cd express-mongodb-crud-api
```
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your MongoDB URI and server port:

```env
MONGO_URI='your_mongodb_connection_string'
PORT=8080
```

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

### 4. Run the server

```sh
npm run dev
```

The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is 8080).

## API Endpoints

Here are the available API endpoints:

### Get all posts

```http
GET /api/posts
```

#### Optional Query Parameter

- `limit`: Limit the number of posts returned (e.g., `/api/posts?limit=2`)

### Get a single post by ID

```http
GET /api/posts/:id
```

### Create a new post

```http
POST /api/posts
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "title": "New Post Title"
}
```

### Update a post by ID

```http
PUT /api/posts/:id
```

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "title": "Updated Post Title"
}
```

### Delete a post by ID

```http
DELETE /api/posts/:id
```
